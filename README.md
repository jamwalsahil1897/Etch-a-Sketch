This project is part the The Odin Project curriculum (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)

When I complete the project, I will come back and write a few reflections.

Notes:
Problem: When page would load, it would create 16 grid spaces. Then, when I change the size, it would create additional grid spaces (and squish leftover grid spaces still in container). I had to delete the grid spaces, when I would re-size.
